## Deep-Think Notes

- Favor official/release-note based changes over trend-only signals.
- Do not apply major upgrades without compatibility matrix + rollback rehearsal.
- Convert repeated wins into reusable rule/skill/hook assets.

## Source Failures

- none

## Next Step

1. Review top P0/P1 actions.
2. Select items for this week's implementation sprint.
3. Open `MACRO_MICRO_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` and execute macro/micro blueprint.
4. Run smoke/regression tests after each applied action.
5. Review `SELF_UPGRADE_PLAN.md` for agent/rule/skill/mcp evolution.
